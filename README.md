# Cilia-motion-phenotyping-
Fully automated and interpretable framework for motion phenotype classification from high-speed microscopy videos. Provides reproducible feature extraction and hierarchical machine learning tools for biomedical video analysis.


The framework implements a fully automated pipeline for high-speed video microscopy (HSVM) analysis, 
including YOLO-based cilia segmentation, dense optical flow, biomechanically interpretable feature 
extraction (vorticity, strain, motion-mask overlap, angular stability, and wave-based periodicity), 
and a hierarchical machine learning architecture for classifying ciliary motion phenotypes 
(immotile, normal, stiff, circular) in the context of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD).

## Contents
- Code for segmentation, optical-flow analysis, feature extraction, and classification
- Example HSVM videos for demonstration purposes
- Scripts to reproduce the main experiments reported in the manuscript

## Data Availability
The analysis code supporting the findings of this study, together with representative HSVM example videos, is publicly available at  [GitHub repository link]. Due to patient privacy and ethical restrictions, the full clinical HSVM dataset cannot be publicly shared. Additional data may be made available upon reasonable request.
